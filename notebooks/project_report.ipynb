    "Environmental protection is one of the main challenges facing our society. Reducing our ecological footprint is essential at every level: from individual behavior to large-scale industrial processes, which remain major contributors to pollution. In this context, our project focuses on coupling reactions, which are widely used in pharmaceutical and materials chemistry, to evaluate their sustainability and explore greener alternatives. Although our algorithm can be applied to other types of reactions, focus made on coupling reaction were choose because they are particularly relevant. These reactions involved metals, solvents, and sometimes extreme conditions, therefore they are ideal real world application to demonstrate the full potential of our green chemistry evaluation algorithm. \n",
