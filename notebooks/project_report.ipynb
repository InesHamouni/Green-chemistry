    "\n",
    "Climate change and pollution are the major challenges of our time, and represent a real threats for both the environment and human health. Slowing down ecological damage is essential and requires public awarness about environmental consequences of human behavior. More broadly, informed people is crucial to drive significant change. Hence, this project was created to help scientists (or users in general) better understand, and above all be aware of the environmental impact of their products. More precisely, the project evaluates chemical reaction sustainability in order to encourage users to explore greener alternatives. The computational analysis primarily focus on coupling reaction since their are widely used in pharmaceutical an materials chemistry (two of the most polluting industries), although our algorithm can be applied to other types of reactions. Coupling reactions involved metals, solvents, and sometimes extreme conditions, therefore they are ideal real world application to highlight the importance of assessing the environmental impact of our reactions. \n",
